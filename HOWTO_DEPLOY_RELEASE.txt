HOWTO DEPLOY OR RELEASE THE PROJECT

### DEPLOYING TO MAVEN REPO ###

See http://jroller.com/holy/entry/releasing_a_project_to_maven

1. PERFORMING A RELEASE
 We use the Maven release plugin to perform releases. It creates a new tag in SVN, updates the project's
 version (removing -SNAPSHOT for deployment and adding it back with version 1 higher after that) etc.
 See comments in the pom.xml for details.

 TODO - release broken, problems with SVN:

2. DEPLOYING NEW FILE VERSIONS W/O DOING A RELEASE
 You can also deploy a new version to the target maven repository without performing a release by executing

 mvn deploy -DperformRelease=true -Dgpg.passphrase=****

 The confusing option performRelease=true is necessary for generating gpg singatures (normally it's set by the release plugin)

 This will build the project and deploy the artifacts to the Sonatype's staging repository
 (you need yet to close and promote the repo. to get them into the public release repository
 and synchronized to Maven Centra.)
 The three options are necessary for generating and deploying also GPG signatures.

### DEPLOYING TO SOURCEFORGE.NET ###

	> New folder named after the release (e.g. 1.1.0)
3. Upload release notes: l-click on the tooth wheel next to the release folder (1.1.0) > Upload here
4. Mark the release notes as release notes: l-click on the tooth wheel next to them > Properties > check Release notes
5. Set the release notes as release notes for the folder:
	click on the release folder (1.1.0) and in the Folder Details box select them
	as the Release notes for this folder
6. Upload all the artifacts (in the form like dbunit-embeddedderby-parenttest-1.1.0.jar
7. Mark the .zip as the default download for any platform:
