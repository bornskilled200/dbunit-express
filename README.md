DbUnit Express
==============

DbUnit Express is a wrapper around DbUnit intended to get you started with DB tests in minimal time
by introducing convention over configuration, being preconfigured for an embedded Derby DB, and providing few utilities.

For details see [http://jakubholynet.github.com/dbunit-express/](http://jakubholynet.github.com/dbunit-express/).

You can get the binaries via Maven or [download dbunit-express from Maven Central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit-express/), see information on the project site.
