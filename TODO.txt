- !!! COPY CHANGES TO CHANGELOG !!!

- wiki: custom EmbeddedDbTester subclass for own data set location strategy etc.

- run DB creator if no DB found ?
- consider making data set used configurable
- consider merging parts of this directly into DbUnit (getDataSource, RowComparator)
- Make it easy to use the data-set-per-test-class strategy e.g. by providing a suitable testDb factory method
